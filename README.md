# Cranium-Backend
Listen to me, I'm 100% okay with ANYONE using this. Please don't go around calling ANYONE a "skidder" I myself used to be one until I gave up on launchers and stuff, if you want a custom backend hit me up on discord.
(I AM NOT WHITEROSE, I AM A FAN OF WHITEROSE)
Also, if your using this backend you'd better credit me (vtable) and if someone is using it without credits please hit me up on discord @krabb_patty It would mean the world to me. 
**DO NOT USE THIS BACKEND UNTIL I CHANGE THIS TEXT RIGHT HERE, IT'S NOT I DONT WANT YOU TO IT'S JUST NOT FINISHED YET, PLEASE AND THANK YOU- vtable**
Update: It's been 3 weeks of no update, I will make sure to comeback and fix all of the stuff and add the routes, it's in progress!
